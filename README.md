# Data-Analysis-3rd-Cohort-Tasks
### Problem Statement
As part of my Excel data class, I was given 4 tasks grouped into 2. This is basically to test my understanding and application of basic excel functions and data manipulation.
### Data Sourcing
Dataset for the first task was generated by inputing random figures by me and it is madeup of 20 rows and 5 columns. 
The second dataset for task 2,3& 4 is a sales dataset with 701 rows and 12 columns (A-L).
Microsoft excel was use for Analysis.
