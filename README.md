# Data-Analysis-3rd-Cohort-Tasks
### Problem Statement
As part of my Excel data class, I was given 4 tasks grouped into 2. This is basically to test my understanding and application of basic excel functions and data manipulation.
### Data Sourcing
Dataset for the first task was generated by inputing random figures by me and it is madeup of 20 rows and 5 columns. 
The second dataset for task 2,3& 4 is a sales dataset with 701 rows and 12 columns (A-L).
Microsoft excel was use for Analysis.
### Data Transformation
The first task is executed on three worksheets, where data were validated.
Conditional formatting was applied to highlight employees who are freelancers and earning above $10,000.
The Text to column feature was used to split the full names into two separate columns. In order not to lose any data an extra column was created beside the full name column so as to create space not yet taken for the split.
Conditional formatting was applied to check and highlight duplicates where it is available in the dataset. 
Conditional formatting was applied to highlight in yellow employees with name starting with letter "E". 
Finally on the first task, conditional formatting was applied to highlight highest salary in green and lowest in red. # colour scale was used green, white and green.
